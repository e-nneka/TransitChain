## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
TransitFlow is a next-generation decentralized application (dapp) that revolutionizes the transportation industry by connecting shippers, carriers, and other stakeholders in a transparent and secure manner. It allows users to access a decentralized marketplace where they can secure capital for their transportation needs, such as freight and logistics, delivery services, and other related ventures.

Through the use of smart contracts and tokenization, TransitFlow streamlines the transportation process by enabling users to invest in tokens that represent a percentage of the overall transportation investment, thus earning returns based on their contribution. With its secure and transparent platform, TransitFlow empowers users to optimize their supply chain, increase their efficiency, and reduce costs associated with traditional transportation methods.

## SMART CONTRACT URL
https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0xe2262d97Eb8b8d07eCcc24C5860DB425b1A09A33#code

## PROJECT DEPENDENCIES
The application relies on a variety of external resources, including dependencies, frameworks, and tool for building and development;
* Solidity - For writing Smart Contracts.
* Remix - For developing and testing the smart contract.
* Hardhat - A development environment and testing framework for building smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
* Javascript - A programming language used for front-end development.
* React.js - Frontend framework for building user interfaces for web and mobile applications.
* Ethers.js -A JavaScript library used for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.

## HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT LOCALLY
* Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/e-nneka/TransitFlow

* Install the dependencies
npm install

* Run the development server
npm run dev

* Connect your MetaMask

* Make investments

## NOTE
TO TEST THIS DAPP, PLEASE ENSURE YOU USE MATIC'S MUMBAI TESTNET IF YOU ARE TESTING IT THROUGH THE URL PROVIDED ABOVE. HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE TESTING THIS DAPP LOCALLY, YOU SHOULD INVEST IN THE FRONTEND USING THE SAME TOKEN THAT WAS USED TO DEPLOY THE SMART CONTRACT. FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU DEPLOYED THE SMART CONTRACT USING MATIC, THEN YOU SHOULD ALSO USE MATIC TO INVEST IN THE FRONTEND.
